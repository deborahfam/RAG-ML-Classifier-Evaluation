    Empirical Altitude–Azimuth Criteria
----------------------------------------

Chunk 6:
The earliest methods rely on empirical relationships between the moon’s altitude and azimuth. Pioneered by Fother-
    ingham [4] and subsequently refined, Ilyas [5], and Fatoohi [6], these criteria are typically expressed as polynomial
----------------------------------------

Chunk 7:
equations that define a threshold for visibility. Although simple and based on direct observational data, these models
    suffer from being overly static; they often fail to capture the variability in atmospheric conditions, observer differences,
----------------------------------------

Chunk 8:
and geographical diversity. For instance, Ilyas’s criterion has been criticized for underestimating the human eye’s
    capability, thereby limiting its practical predictive power.
    2.2
    Lunar Cycle Analysis
----------------------------------------

Chunk 9:
Another approach focuses on the statistical examination of lunar cycle patterns [7] [8]. These analyses explore the
    frequency of 29- versus 30-day months and compare the resulting patterns with observational data. While they provide
----------------------------------------

Chunk 10:
insight into the broader calendrical implications of crescent sightings, their main shortcoming lies in the inherent
    variability of lunar cycles. Each cycle is unique because of factors like sun–moon declination differences, observer
----------------------------------------

Chunk 11:
location, and atmospheric influences; thus, the lunar cycle approach is less reliable for predicting individual crescent
    sightings or for forming a robust calendrical criterion.
    2.3
    Arc of Vision Versus Arc of Light (Elongation) Criteria
----------------------------------------

Chunk 12:
Modern calendrical systems have also adopted criteria based on a combination of the arc of vision (the altitude
    difference between the moon and the sun) and the arc of light (or elongation) [2]. These methods aim to eliminate
----------------------------------------

Chunk 13:
false-positive sightings by setting a lower boundary that positive observations must exceed. Yet, their rigidity—often
    designed specifically to support a calendrical framework—can lead to cases where real, but borderline, observations are
----------------------------------------

Chunk 14:
disregarded. In particular, the criteria can be too conservative, especially when distinguishing between naked-eye and
    optical-aided observations
    2.4
    Arc of Vision Versus Width Criteria
----------------------------------------

Chunk 15:
Introduced by Bruin [9] and later adapted by researchers such as Yallop [10], Odeh [11], Qureshi [12], and Alrefay et al
    [13], these criteria extend the analysis by incorporating the lunar crescent’s width into the visibility equation. Although
----------------------------------------

Chunk 16:
this method adds a valuable geometric dimension that can also predict observation windows, it is hampered by the
    difficulty in accurately predicting crescent visibility because the empirical conditions cannot reflect the actual crescent

visibility in a country.
    2.5
    Lag Time–Based Criteria
    Lag time, the interval between sunset (or moonset) and the relevant lunar phase, has also been used as a predictor [14].
----------------------------------------

Chunk 18:
While lag time is intuitively appealing (longer intervals are thought to correlate with easier visibility), its predictive
    power is undermined by low correlation coefficients and its sensitivity to observer latitude. In high-latitude regions, for
----------------------------------------

Chunk 19:
example, the lunar crescent’s slanted path significantly alters lag time, rendering it less reliable as a sole or primary
    parameter in visibility criteria.
----------------------------------------

Chunk 20:
Despite the notable advancements achieved by state-of-the-art methods, these techniques are fundamentally limited
    by their reliance on static, one-size-fits-all thresholds. Such rigidity hinders their ability to accommodate the inherent
