Maybe switching between laptop and mobile is good, maybe it is bad, depends.\n\nDear god do we have more data now, your device, the text of the conversation, and a hundred other points of metadata.\n\nSo how on earth do I create metrics to reliably identify our Good Conversations, and our Bad Conversations, so I can measure success? improvement?
