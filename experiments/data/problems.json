Currently, we have a lot of data from our customers, but we don't manage to understand well their behaviors to make business decisions.\n\nFor example:\n\nSome customers rent cars frequently but only for a few days.\n\nOthers rent infrequently, but spend a lot of money on each reservation.\n\nSome rent for weeks or months at a time.\n\nAnd then there are the rest, who don't fit into any clear pattern.\n\nWe want to group these customers intelligently so we can offer them personalized promotions, improve our car inventory (more luxury vehicles? more economy options?) and optimize our marketing campaigns."

Maybe switching between laptop and mobile is good, maybe it is bad, depends.\n\nDear god do we have more data now, your device, the text of the conversation, and a hundred other points of metadata.\n\nSo how on earth do I create metrics to reliably identify our Good Conversations, and our Bad Conversations, so I can measure success? improvement? Learn from Good Conversations? Fix Bad Conversations? etc."
